        <p class="mb-0">
        We created a user-friendly, fully-responsive multiple-page website for Athletica
        Gym leveraging the power of Bootstrap 5. The branded header has a sticker navbar
        with links to Home, Products, Facilities, Nutrition, Making of and Our Story.
        For the first-run login, the user enters their name and phone number, and their
        login state is saved in localStorage. When a user log offs the program, they
        experience a minimal registration flow. The Home area included a selected
        product list that shows product badges, product pricing, and a prominent
        More button that shows the rest of the product list. The Facilities section
        included a grid view of the facility's equipment, which would adapt from
        mobile to desktop, and the Nutrition shown a clean layout for the calculator
        and related recommendations based on activity level. We defined three membership
        plans, (Basic, Pro, and Premium) which resulted in premium features being gated
        for those premium members. We added member reviews to build consumer trust and
        social proof. Each page also offers a compact footer composed of social icons on
        the left and an email signup form on the far right. Overall, accessibility, multi-device
        display capabilities, consistent spacing and load time, fixed common layout bugs,
        and clean display across devices were considered.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Below are the key issues we faced during development and the concrete steps we took to resolve them.
          Our aim was to keep the notes concise and easy to scan while documenting fixes we can reuse across
          the project. By standardizing how we serve assets, optimize images, structure responsive layouts,
          and approach debugging, we improved reliability and reduced time-to-fix. These decisions also give
          new contributors a clear starting point, explain why certain utilities and patterns were chosen,
          and help prevent the same problems from resurfacing as the codebase grows.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mb-1 text-warning">Running from Local File Paths</h2>
        <p>
          During the development phase, we kept running into weird problems whenever we opened the site using the file:// protocol.
          Changing into a local HTTP server (like Live Server or Vite preview) solved the issue all components loaded perfectly, 
          images used the right paths, and the development matched the behavior of a real, published website.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mb-1 text-warning">Image Clarity &amp; Scaling</h2>
        <p>
          Some assets were low-resolution or stretched beyond their native size. We replaced weak images with
          higher-resolution WebP/AVIF where possible, enforced stable aspect ratios with Bootstrap's
          ratio-* utilities (e.g., ratio-4x3, ratio-1x1), and applied
          img-fluid to prevent overflow. When needed, we used object-fit: cover to avoid
          distortion and added lazy loading to improve performance on mobile networks.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mb-1 text-warning">Responsiveness Across Devices</h2>
        <p >
          Early layouts didn't adapt cleanly at every breakpoint. 
          We were relying on manual lg, md, and sm settings, which caused sections to shift or scale incorrectly on different screens.
          We refactored using the container/row/col-* grid, applied row-cols-* to control gallery density, and balanced spacing with utilities like g-* and py-*. 
          We tested across multiple viewport widths, checking keyboard navigation and zoom, to ensure a stable and accessible experience.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mb-1 text-warning">Debugging &amp; Stability</h2>
        <p class="mb-0">
        Our first major problem was the login system, since it was the first JavaScript we ever wrote. 
        We didn't know how to apply proper validation rules like enforcing a minimum name length, requiring an
        8-digit password, or showing clear error messages so the login flow was unstable and didn't behave as expected.

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mb-2">Front-end development</h2>
        <p class="text-body mb-3">
          We moved beyond “it works” to “it’s accessible, maintainable, and consistent.” In HTML, we used semantic structure with clear headings, landmarks, and alt text to improve accessibility and SEO. In CSS, we kept selectors shallow, avoided specificity fights, and leaned on Bootstrap utilities for spacing, layout, and typography so components stay unified. Media stayed crisp using responsive images (<code>img-fluid</code>) and stable aspect ratios via Bootstrap's <code>ratio</code> helpers. In JavaScript, we preferred smaller, pure functions, added null checks before DOM operations, and standardized error handling and formatting making the codebase easier to review and extend.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mb-2">Collaboration & communication</h2>
        <p class="text-body mb-3">
        Our communication was straightforward and effective. 
        We divided the work by setting clear roles: each member took ownership of a specific page, one focused on the JavaScript logic, another handled design improvements, and another reviewed the project and removed unnecessary code. 
        We kept each other updated through short check-ins and shared progress as tasks were completed. Our final meeting was the longest, lasting almost five hours, where we refined the project together and made sure everything was consistent before submission. 
        This approach helped us stay organized, avoid duplicated work, and maintain a unified style across all pages.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mb-2">Responsive design with Bootstrap</h2>
        <p class="text-body mb-3">
          We built mobile-first and layered breakpoints for smooth scaling. Image grids adapt using <code>row-cols-3</code> on small screens and <code>row-cols-lg-5</code> on large, with <code>g-3</code>/<code>g-lg-4</code> for balanced spacing. Layout order stays intuitive (text left, media right) using grid columns and <code>order-*</code> utilities. We stabilized aspect ratios with <code>ratio-1x1</code> and <code>ratio-4x3</code>, optimized assets (WebP/AVIF), and used lazy loading to improve performance.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4 fw-semibold mb-2">Problem-solving</h2>
        <p class="text-body mb-0">
          When something broke whether it was file:// issues, stretched images, weird layouts, or the login form we reproduced the bug, changed one thing, and tested again. We mainly used DevTools (console errors, element inspector, and responsive view) plus simple console.log() checks to see where the logic failed. After each fix, we quickly re-tested the main pages and the login/register flow to make sure nothing else was accidentally broken.
